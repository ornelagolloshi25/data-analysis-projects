# We want to COMPLETELY reverse a list by flipping the order of the entries AND flipping the order of characters in each element.

# a) Define a 'reverse_characters' function. Give it one parameter, which will be the string to reverse.
# b) Within the function, use the 'list' function to split a string into a list of individual characters
# c) 'reverse' your new list.
# d) Use 'join' to create the reversed string and return that string from the function.
# e) Create a variable of type string to test your new function. 
# f) Use 'print(reverse_characters(my_variable_name))'; to call the function and verify that it correctly reverses the characters in the string.
# g) Use method chaining to reduce the lines of code within the function.

def reverse_characters(s):
    return ''.join(list(s)[::-1])

my_string = "Python"

print(reverse_characters(my_string))
