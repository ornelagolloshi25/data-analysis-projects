# Exercises: Complex queries

For the exercises, you are tasked with writing five queries that will help you delve deeper into BooksDB. 
You can choose whether you want to use a correlated subquery, a nested subquery, the UNION operator, the INTERSECT operator, 
or the EXCEPT operator for each one. 
You may not use joins or add multiple statements to the WHERE clause.

5.Â Write a query that returns the names of the tags and the tag ids for tags that were used over 100,000 times for a book.
