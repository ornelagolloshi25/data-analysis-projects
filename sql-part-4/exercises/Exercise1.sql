# Exercises: Complex queries

For the exercises, you are tasked with writing five queries that will help you delve deeper into BooksDB. 
You can choose whether you want to use a correlated subquery, a nested subquery, the UNION operator, the INTERSECT operator, 
or the EXCEPT operator for each one. 
You may not use joins or add multiple statements to the WHERE clause.

1.Â Write a query that will return the number of users who rated a book above it's average rating.

SELECT r.book_id, AVG(rating)
FROM BooksDB.dbo.ratings AS r
GROUP BY r.book_id;


--return the rating table
SELECT *
FROM BooksDB.dbo.ratings;

-- number of users who rated a book above it's average rating
-- Problem: The soame ID is showing more then one time
SELECT r.user_id
